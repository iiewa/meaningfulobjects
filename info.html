        <h2>MORE INFO</h2>
        <p>*</p>
        <p>I asked twenty-three of my friends to tell me about the objects that are or were important to them. This book is a compilation of their responses, including size specifications, the number of days they’ve had the objects for, and a piece of advice they would impart to themselves in that period of their lives. Some sections also include excerpts from their reflections during our conversation.</p> 
        <p>It was so lovely to hear everyone speak about the experiences, relationships, and interests that meant a lot to—or even shaped—them. I appreciate how incredibly thoughtful and willing to share each person was. Making this book has given us the opportunity to discuss topics that we might not typically explore, and for that I’m immensely grateful.</p>
